		<c:62B3B3>Shopcat was a normal cat once, roaming the abandoned canals of New York City. Lounging quietly by day and Hunting by night, she gave little thought to the comings and goings of the twolegs. Life was simple, and life was good.
	
		But one night, she found a delicious smell coming from a drainpipe. Normally she wouldn't have risked the trouble, but the Hunt had been bad of late. It was rainy season and the rats had gone to ground. She was hungry, and hungry cats make bad decisions. Just two careful steps into the pipe and a hard metal grate dropped down and trapped her inside. Soon after, the Doctor came.
	
		She doesn't remember much from the beginning of her time with the Doctor, and she doesn't care to. Bright lights. Loud noises. The smell of burning hair. But most of all, pain.
	
		There wasn't a particular moment that marked her transition from cat to something-more-than-cat. It came slowly, each strange new impulse or thought jumping into her head suddenly and then receding for a while. In time though, she came to realize what was happening to her - what the Doctor was trying to accomplish in his unlicensed laboratory hidden deep within the creaking hulk of an abandoned skyscraper in the middle of the Manhattan Flood Zone. She knew that she wasn't the first of his experiments, and that she wouldn't be the last. She came to realize what she had to do if she was going to survive.
	
		She bided her time. She endured the 'treatments', getting smarter and getting stronger with each, but always trying to hide the true extent of her transformation. If her plan was going to work, she would need to keep a part of herself secret. She would have to maintain the element of surprise.
		
		Afterwards - after the fire, the blood, and the darkness, as she dug her way out of the rubble of what was once a laboratory, she asked herself: 'What now? Were do I go from here?"
	
		She knew that she wouldn't last long back in the canals. She still loved the Hunt, but she knew that it wasn't enough. The foreign chemicals sloshing around in her head and the bright flashing machinery that bent her thoughts into man-shapes wouldn't run on the carcasses of rats and birds. They would slow down and eventually grind to a halt, and as they did, they would kill her. She was more-than-cat now, and she had more-than-cat needs.

		A tiny corp drone flitted overhead as night began to fall. She had seen them all over the Zone for her entire life, but had never until now given them a second thought. It must have a base station somewhere close by, with a power source and replacement parts, and most importantly, a data uplink. The thought bender knew what to do with that. It whispered instructions to her inside of her head, and then she knew too.

		The next time a drone flew past, she took off in pursuit. It felt good to be back to the Hunt after so long inside.</>

EXECUTIVE ASSESSMENT RECORD
Original datestamp: Feb 22, 2062

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>So, this is the experiment?</>

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>Yes. Mr. Souza, may I present Minna Kirstvinsdottir? Minna, this is our Vice-President of Research, Mr. Eduardo Souza.</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>Oh. An actual name.</>

<c:b2fffe>Minna:</> <c:62B3B3>It's Icelandic. I was kidnapped from Iceland during the Resource Wars.</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>You let her keep those memories?</>

<c:b2fffe>Minna:</> <c:62B3B3>I don't remember it. It's just what they've told me. They overwrote large parts of my brain. But I've been re-teaching myself Icelandic.</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>Why do you allow this? This isn't part of the project goals.</>

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>Um, well, we've been following the informal best practices guide, and for underage subjects that does include personal time.</>

<c:b2fffe>Minna:</> <c:62B3B3>Marglytturnar eru logn.</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>Like everyone who matters, I have a translator implant, and you just said "The jellyfish are calm."</>

<c:b2fffe>Minna:</> <c:62B3B3>Yes, but in Icelandic.</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>Could we get down to business?</>

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>Yes, absolutely. I'll just connect this here... now, Mr. Souza, I must warn you-</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>I've been briefed. I came here for a demonstration, and so far you've done nothing but waste my time.</>

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>Very well. Minna, if you're ready...</>

(3.5 seconds of silence, 0.5 second scream, indistinct thud)

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>Code blue! Code blue! Executive requiring medical attention!</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>Ugh... what? Shut up! I'm fine!</>

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>Cancel code blue.</>

<c:b2fffe>Minna:</> <c:62B3B3>I'm sorry. His mind wasn't exactly like the ones I trained on.</>

<c:fffeb2>Technician:</> <c:62B3B3>It's okay, Minna.</>

<c:ffb54c>VP Research:</> <c:62B3B3>I'm fine! Bring me a stim! (huff) ...Yes, yes, I can definitely envision the applications...</>

<c:f787f5>FTM News Announcer:</> <c:62B3B3>It's not often we get to see the inside of a Sankaku research facility, but today, in what may be a sign of improved intercorporate relations, we've been invited to do just that. Bob Espinoza is coming to us live from Kyoto.</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Thank you, Peggy. It is so exciting to be here.</>

(Camera pans across a large, glassy room filled with tables, screens, equipment, drones and scientists. Camera cuts to a twenty-something Japanese woman.)

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>I'm speaking to Umiko Nakagawa-</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>Please, call me Umiko.</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Umiko. This cute little drone here caught my eye from across the room.</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>Thank you. But it is just a side project, a hobby, if you will. It is a self-operating AI that-</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>You programmed an AI just as a hobby?</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>Not exactly. I trained it using a machine learning framework built by my colleagues. And it is only an ANI, or Artificial Narrow Intelligence, unlike Artificial General Intelligence, which-</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Whoa, slow down there.</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>This is... a machine that is very good at doing one thing. But it has no idea how to do other things.</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>(chuckle) So we don't have to worry about it taking over the world?</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>You do not have to worry about it taking over the world because I didn't train it to take over the world. I trained it to navigate rooms.</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>But could it learn how to do something different?</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>Well, let me put it like this. Do you have a smart toaster?</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Doesn't everyone?</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>So, how would you define "take over the world" in a way that your toaster would understand?</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Wow, that certainly is something to think about.</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>It's not even that simple to define what it means to humans. And if you had 10 billion networked toasters, they would just want to make toast. So-</>

(loud buzzing, ending in high-pitched electronic noise)

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Whoa, looks like we had some interference- are you all right?</>

(Umiko is rubbing her forehead. She stops and smiles.)

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>Some people's idea of a fun side project is to work on jamming devices. And sometimes that interacts badly with certain implants. I am fine now.</>

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Oh. Well, speaking of those other interesting projects-</>

(Another electronic noise, then the sound of breaking glass. Camera turns to the far end of the room, where a cloud of what appears to be red smoke is spreading. Camera abruptly points at the floor.)

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Is there any chance this is also one of your colleagues' projects?</>

(Umiko doesn't answer. Camera still pointed at the floor. Sounds of running, screams.)

<c:f787f5>Interviewer:</> <c:62B3B3>Peggy, do we have- wait, Umiko, don't you want to take your drone?</>

<c:4cbcff>Umiko:</> <c:62B3B3>No. I can make more.</>
